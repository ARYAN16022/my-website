        <p>We tried creating a simple sample project to help you get inspired and started. Here is a ball bouncing off inside a
        tunnel</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>2nd game<a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/N5pfTHHM9EeCXq8dtI1h0ePoKUZoE_dBfbpmiIRKXIs"><img src="Icons/2nd.jpg"></img></a></h2>
        <p>Create a carrom board game where you have a disk that you control using the arrow keys.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>3rd game<a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/nNN1RwCGoUCBzAp-9XMxPA0MsCaLYhz-itkFZRjbMFQ"><img src="Icons/3rd.jpg"></img></a></h2>
        <p>In Class C3, you learned to control the bouncy ball movements. You also learned about conditional programming and made a
        small little game.
        
        Ready to make the game more challenging and fun to play?</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>4th game<a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/ezqAg_FqCSiXCK8fFDG7xqIHiaquxWZTxw5E7yhDCGE"><img src="Icons/4th.jpg"></img></a></h2>
        <p>In this project, you will have to practice and apply what you have learnt in the class and apply the images of the
        vegetables.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>5th game<a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/qbdnWNCLsxm7cS1ZzLeCqDoijQY0MaqZ0VEcvWXiH2g"><img src="Icons/5th.jpg"></img></a></h2>
        <p>They are trying to make it for a single player. The other player would be a Sensor Robot which will move according to
        the moves made by the striker. The motive is that even if a kid doesn’t have a partner to play with, he or she can play
        against the robot and enjoy the game to the fullest.
        
        Can you help Crafty Child create this new interesting game?</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>6th game<a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/SsHAo56YxUQnfhnbAJAnvLRBscBegsfgZ5fF8DMuFAc"><img src="Icons/6th.jpg"></img></a></h2>
        <p>Every game has a few simple components…
        
        The player playing the game should have a goal. It should give you obstacles to overcome. And it should offer you
        feedback on how you are doing in the game. Additionally, good games also have some story behind them.
        
        With all these points in mind, design your own game with your own character, goals, obstacles, feedback and a story.</p>

        <p>So far you have helped Meera a great deal to design a game of bursting balloons with an arrow. Now this is the last step
        to complete the game. You need to add a feature to the game where when an arrow hits a balloon, it gets destroyed.

        Now you have to make the game interesting by adding a scoreboard, images and animations to the game. To make it even
        more exciting, increase the size of the monkey after eating bananas and decrease its size if it falls or hits an
        obstacle.</p>
